This way one can scroll through them and have a sense of them. Also, it should automatically display them on the most likely scenario, and it should be up to the user to decide to explore above and below average T scenario","","You need to keep in mind who the user is. Why do they need the service? Why do they need uncertainty? There is no single best way to do this. The type of information displayed must fit the user's needs, and the user's might have very different backgrounds (especially form you). For example, who would use a map of Andalucia like this one? A farmer with a few hectares of peach orchards might want to know if the temperature is increasing in their area, and roughly how likely that is (so maybe three to five scenarios, one being the most likely and the others being above and below average around 1 st.dev). While an insurance company working with hundreds of farmers might actually care about the minutia of the uncertainties since they might want to run a risk assessment of their various options.

Anyway, you are doing a great job! It will make for a great master thesis! However, remember that the ultimate goals are for the information to be used in a way that facilitates the user's adaptive decision making. "

Sure the map 1 with the option to select the differents models would make people think there is no certainty at all. I like more the idea to visualise the deviations."

I thought it would probably represent mean June temp of the multiple climate correction, but that was only stated in map 3 I believe. The full information used to derive the map should be stated I think, or be able to link to, e.g. something like: The mean June 2030 temperature was derived by averaging the daily mean temperatures from 1-30 June of the years 2020-2040 simulation output from the 82 climate scenarios as reported in the 5th IPCC report.. As this information was not provided, in principle in my view for non of the maps the uncertainty could be assessed, but as I understand this exercise to focus on the visualisation and map options, I answered assuming I knew how the maps were derived.","I do not know how these example maps were derived, but perhaps just to be sure to share that climate models used to simulate the climate scenarios as far as I am aware come with the advice to not use a simulation result in a particular month and year as a prediction of what will happen in exactly that year. To get an idea of how the climate will look like around the year 2050 for example, we are advised to derive model-output statistics from multiple years around 2050, e.g. 2035-2065. Very nice examples of visualisation maps, and very useful exercise and research. Looking forward to see your analysis results."
